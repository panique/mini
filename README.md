[![MINI - A naked barebone PHP application](_installation/php-mini.png)](http://www.php-mini.com)

# MINI

MINI is an extremely simple and easy to understand skeleton PHP application, reduced to the max.
MINI is NOT a professional framework and it does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have.
If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without
reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks, then MINI might be very useful for you.
MINI is easy to install, runs nearly everywhere and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.

## Features

- extremely simple, easy to understand
- simple but clean structure
- makes "beautiful" clean URLs
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily
- demo AJAX call
- tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- commented code
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.0+
- MySQL
- mod_rewrite activated (tutorials below)

## Installation

1. Edit the database credentials in `application/config/config.php`
2. Execute the .sql statements in the `_installation/`-folder (running `_installation/demo-db.sh <sql username>` or PHPMyAdmin for example).
3. Make sure you have mod_rewrite activated on your server / in your environment. Some guidelines:
   [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-14-04-lts/),
   [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-12-04-lts/),
   [EasyPHP on Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8158770/easyphp-and-htaccess),
   [AMPPS on Windows/Mac OS](http://www.softaculous.com/board/index.php?tid=3634&title=AMPPS_rewrite_enable/disable_option%3F_please%3F),
   [XAMPP for Windows](http://www.leonardaustin.com/blog/technical/enable-mod_rewrite-in-xampp/),
   [MAMP on Mac OS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp)

MINI runs without any further configuration.

## When installing in a sub-folder

In case you run the script inside a sub-folder: Then the AJAX-calls will not work by default. To fix this, you'll need
to add the folder's name to all paths in AJAX-calls in `public/js/application.js`. This will be fixed in future
versions.

## Security

The script makes use of mod_rewrite and blocks all access to everything outside the /public folder.
Your .git folder/files, operating system temp files, the application-folder and everything else is not accessible
(when set up correctly). For database requests PDO is used, so no need to think about SQL injection.

## Goodies

MINI comes with a little PDO debugger tool, making it easy to see your PDO statements.

## History

MINI is the successor of php-mvc. As php-mvc didn't provide a real MVC structure (and several people complained
about that - which is totally right!) I've renamed and rebuild the project.

## Dear haters, trolls and everything-sucks-people...

... MINI is just a simple helper-tool I've created for my daily work, simply because it was much easier to setup and to
handle than real frameworks. For daily agency work, quick prototyping and frontend-driven projects it's totally okay.

I've written this unpaid, voluntarily, in my free-time and uploaded it on GitHub to share.
It's totally free, for private and commercial use. If you don't like it, don't use it.
If you see issues, then please write a ticket (and if you are really cool: I'm very thankful for any commits!).
But don't bash, don't complain, don't hate. Only bad people do so.

## Contribute

Please commit into the develop branch (which holds the in-development version), not into master branch
(which holds the tested and stable version).
