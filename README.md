[![MINI - A naked barebone PHP application](_installation/php-mini.png)](http://www.php-mini.com)

# MINI

MINI is an extremely simple and easy to understand skeleton PHP application, reduced to the max.
MINI is NOT a professional framework and it does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have.
If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without
reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks, then MINI might be very useful for you.
MINI is easy to install, runs nearly everywhere and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.

## Features

- extremely simple, easy to understand
- simple but clean structure
- makes "beautiful" clean URLs
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily
- demo AJAX call
- tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- commented code
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework

## Forks of MINI
 
MINI has a smaller brother, named [TINY](https://github.com/panique/tiny). It's similar to MINI, but runs without 
mod_rewrite in nearly every environment. Not suitable for live sites, but nice for quick prototyping.
 
MINI also has a bigger brother, named MINI2. It's in development and comes with an improved architecture, 
SASS-compiling, Twig, Unit Tests, etc.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.0+
- MySQL
- mod_rewrite activated (tutorials below, but there's also [TINY](https://github.com/panique/tiny), a mod_rewrite-less 
version of MINI)

## Installation

1. Edit the database credentials in `application/config/config.php`
2. Execute the .sql statements in the `_installation/`-folder (running `_installation/demo-db.sh <sql username>` or PHPMyAdmin for example).
3. Make sure you have mod_rewrite activated on your server / in your environment. Some guidelines:
   [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-14-04-lts/),
   [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-12-04-lts/),
   [EasyPHP on Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8158770/easyphp-and-htaccess),
   [AMPPS on Windows/Mac OS](http://www.softaculous.com/board/index.php?tid=3634&title=AMPPS_rewrite_enable/disable_option%3F_please%3F),
   [XAMPP for Windows](http://www.leonardaustin.com/blog/technical/enable-mod_rewrite-in-xampp/),
   [MAMP on Mac OS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp)

MINI runs without any further configuration. You can also put it inside a sub-folder, it will work without any 
further configuration.

## Documentation

A very early documentation can be found on [php-mini.com/documentation](http://php-mini.com/documentation/).

## Server configs for

### nginx

TODO

### IIS

TODO

## Security

The script makes use of mod_rewrite and blocks all access to everything outside the /public folder.
Your .git folder/files, operating system temp files, the application-folder and everything else is not accessible
(when set up correctly). For database requests PDO is used, so no need to think about SQL injection (unless you
are using extremely outdated MySQL versions).

## Goodies

MINI comes with a little customized [PDO debugger tool](https://github.com/panique/pdo-debug) (find the code in
application/libs/helper.php), trying to emulate your PDO-SQL statements. It's extremely easy to use:

```php
$sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song WHERE id = :song_id LIMIT 1";
$query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
$parameters = array(':song_id' => $song_id);

echo Helper::debugPDO($sql, $parameters);

$query->execute($parameters);
```

## Quick-Start

#### The structure in general

The application's URL-path translates directly to the controllers (=files) and their methods inside 
application/controllers. 

`example.com/home/exampleOne` will do what the *exampleOne()* method in application/controllers/home.php says.

`example.com/home` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/home.php says.

`example.com` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/home.php says (default fallback).

`example.com/songs` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/songs.php says.

`example.com/songs/editsong/17` will do what the *editsong()* method in application/controllers/songs.php says and
will pass `17` as a parameter to it.

Self-explaining, right ?

#### Showing a view

Let's look at the exampleOne()-method in the home-controller (application/controllers/home.php): This simply shows
the header, footer and the example_one.php page (in views/home/). By intention as simple and native as possible.

```php
public function exampleOne()
{
    // load view
    require APP . 'views/_templates/header.php';
    require APP . 'views/home/example_one.php';
    require APP . 'views/_templates/footer.php';
}
```  

#### Working with data

Let's look into the index()-method in the songs-controller (application/controllers/songs.php): Similar to exampleOne,
but here we also request data. Again, everything is extremely reduced and simple: $this->model->getAllSongs() simply
calls the getAllSongs()-method in application/model/model.php.

```php
public function index()
{
    // getting all songs and amount of songs
    $songs = $this->model->getAllSongs();
    $amount_of_songs = $this->model->getAmountOfSongs();

   // load view. within the view files we can echo out $songs and $amount_of_songs easily
    require APP . 'views/_templates/header.php';
    require APP . 'views/songs/index.php';
    require APP . 'views/_templates/footer.php';
}
```

For extreme simplicity, all data-handling methods are in application/model/model.php. This is for sure not really
professional, but the most simple implementation. Have a look how getAllSongs() in model.php looks like: Pure and
super-simple PDO.

```php
public function getAllSongs()
{
    $sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song";
    $query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
    $query->execute();
    
    return $query->fetchAll();
}
```

The result, here $songs, can then easily be used directly
inside the view files (in this case application/views/songs/index.php, in a simplified example):

```php
<tbody>
<?php foreach ($songs as $song) { ?>
    <tr>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->artist)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->artist, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->track)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->track, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
    </tr>
<?php } ?>
</tbody>
```

## History

MINI is the successor of php-mvc. As php-mvc didn't provide a real MVC structure (and several people complained
about that - which is totally right!) I've renamed and rebuild the project.

## Dear haters, trolls and everything-sucks-people...

... MINI is just a simple helper-tool I've created for my daily work, simply because it was much easier to setup and to
handle than real frameworks. For daily agency work, quick prototyping and frontend-driven projects it's totally okay,
does the job and there's absolutely no reason to discuss why it's "shit compared to Laravel", why it does not follow 
several MVC principles or why there's no personal unpaid support or no russian translation or similar weird stuff. 
The trolling against Open-Source-projects (and their authors) has really reached insane dimensions.

I've written this unpaid, voluntarily, in my free-time and uploaded it on GitHub to share.
It's totally free, for private and commercial use. If you don't like it, don't use it.
If you see issues, then please write a ticket (and if you are really cool: I'm very thankful for any commits!).
But don't bash, don't complain, don't hate. Only bad people do so.

## Contribute

Please commit into the develop branch (which holds the in-development version), not into master branch
(which holds the tested and stable version).
