/**
 * Configuration for: URL
 * Here we auto-detect your applications URL and the potential sub-folder. Works perfectly on most servers and in local
 * development environments (like WAMP, MAMP, etc.). Don't touch this unless you know what you do.
 *
 * URL_PUBLIC_FOLDER:
 * The folder that is visible to public, users will only have access to that folder so nobody can have a look into
 * "/application" or other folder inside your application or call any other .php file than index.php inside "/public".
 *
 * URL_PROTOCOL:
 * The protocol. Don't change unless you know exactly what you do. This defines the protocol part of the URL, in older
 * versions of MINI it was 'http://' for normal HTTP and 'https://' if you have a HTTPS site for sure. Now the
 * protocol-independent '//' is used, which auto-recognized the protocol.
 *
 * URL_DOMAIN:
 * The domain. Don't change unless you know exactly what you do.
 *
 * URL_SUB_FOLDER:
 * The sub-folder. Leave it like it is, even if you don't use a sub-folder (then this will be just "/").
 *
 * URL:
 * The final, auto-detected URL (build via the segments above). If you don't want to use auto-detection,
 * then replace this line with full URL (and sub-folder) and a trailing slash.
